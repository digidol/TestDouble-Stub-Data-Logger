# About this project
This project is an example of using a Test Stub (a type of Test Double) to 
replace a network connection during testing.

# Building the Project
You can load this into your preferred IDE and run it. Use the facilities in your IDE 
to run the test phases. 

Instead of running this through the IDE, you can also run the tests from the 
command line using Maven. In the same folder as the `pom.xml` file, you can type `mvn test`. 
That will build the project and then run the tests. 

To run from the command line, you will need to download [Maven](http://maven.apache.org) 
and setup the path so that you can run the `mvn` command.


# Exercise 
Develop and run tests for `ResponderStubNetworkConnectionTest`, 
`SaboteurStubNetworkConnectionTest` and `DataLogger`.
