/**
 * This class represents one that is designed to test situations where errors are
 * thrown from the network connection. In particular, it simulates the following errors:
 *
 *  <ul>
 *     <li>
 *     If the connection is opened for COM1, an exception will be thrown.
 *     In this situation, later attempts to read from the readData() method will
 *     also throw an exception.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *     When reading data, there will be an IOException after the 10th data read.
 *     This is for the purpose of this example. A real project would need to
 *     decide what invalid values it wanted to test.
 *     </li>
 *  </ul>
